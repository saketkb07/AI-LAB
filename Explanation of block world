AIM: To implement the block world problem using correct artificial
intelligence optimization techniques.

ALGORITHM:
1.Initialise a stack to store the blocks.
2.Make sure the stack is empty when HEAD NODE.NEXT =
NULL
3.Read the pattern of blocks given label it START STATE
4.Compare the given pattern to the given final pattern label it
GOAL STATE
05.Now start the movement of the blocks one by on either one on
top or to the floor according to the need.
6.Keep recording these movements in the empty stack created by
STACK.PUSH and STACK.POP methods.
7.Stop the block manipulation when goal state is reached.

OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUE :
➢ Here keeping track of movement of the block is the main
problem, if we keep traversing the floor again and again after
each move, our time complexity will be O(n^2) which is
exponentially higher than what is needed and should be
avoided.

➢ To solve this problem STACK data structure can be used, so
whenever a movement is made the movement can be
conveniently stored in the stack which will be initialized as
empty which HEAD.NEXT = NULL.

➢ When the block is to be added to the sequence of blocks
simply use STACK.PUSH() to make the movement. And
when a block is supposed to be removed from the pattern of
blocks STACK.POP() can be used to make that movement.

➢ Implementing this will bring down the time complexity from
O(n) and worst case of O(n^2) to O(1) that is unit time which
is a major optimization from exponential time.
