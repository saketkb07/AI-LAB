------------------EXPERIMENT 1--------------------
Aim :-  To find the maximum number of bananas that can be delivered by camel to the market.
Procedure:-
We have a total of 3000 bananas.
The destination is 1000KMs
Only 1 mode of transport.
Camel can carry a maximum of 1000 banana at a time.
Camel eats a banana every km it travels.
With all these points, we can say that person wonâ€™t we able to transfer any banana
to the destination as the camel is going to eat all the banana on its way to the
destination.
But the trick here is to have intermediate drop points, then, the camel can make
several short trips in between.
Also, we try to maintain the number of bananas at each point to be multiple of
1000.


Code:-
total=int(input('Enter no. of bananas at starting'))
distance=int(input('Enter distance you want to cover'))
load_capacity=int(input('Enter max load capacity of your camel'))
lose=0
start=total
for i in range(distance):
    while start>0:
        start=start-load_capacity
#Here if condition is checking that camel doesn't move back if there is only one banana left.
        if start==1:
            lose=lose-1#Lose is decreased because if camel try to get remaining one banana he will lose one extra banana for covering that two miles.
#Here we are increasing lose because for moving backward and forward by one mile two bananas will be lose
        lose=lose+2
#Here lose is decreased as in last trip camel will not go back.
    lose=lose-1
    start=total-lose
    if start==0:#Condition to check whether it is possible to take a single banana or not.
        break
print(start)


Output:-
Enter no. of bananas at starting:3000
Enter distance you want to cover:1000
Enter max load capacity of your camel:1000
